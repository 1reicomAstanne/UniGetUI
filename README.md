## How does Xfmccs6exe Adobe Acrobat work?
 
Xfmccs6exe Adobe Acrobat works by exploiting a vulnerability in the Adobe Acrobat X Pro software.

According to Adobe, this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild in limited attacks targeting Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
 
Xfmccs6exe Adobe Acrobat uses this vulnerability to inject its own code into the Adobe Acrobat X Pro software. The code then generates a fake serial number and patches the software to bypass the online activation process. The code may also perform other malicious actions, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or downloading more malware.
